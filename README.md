# Mathematical Algorithm Problems

## Algorithm Questions
Please refer to the PDF for the answer to the following algorithm questions:

1) Given an array of non-negative numbers, give a naive algorithm with time complexity O(n^2) to find a continuous subarray with sum of S.

2) Can you find a more efficient solution? What is the time complexity of this solution?

3) What approach would you take to the problem if we removed the constraints of the numbers being non-negative and the subarray being continuous?  What would be the time complexity of a solution using this approach?
